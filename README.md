# Bank-Note-Authentication-
### Techniques used : MLP, Decsion Tree, Naive Bayes Classifier

### AIM 
  Despite the fact that money now exists as credit money or as electronic records stored in databases, currency remains the backbone of everyday transactions. If the notes used by the people of the country are duplicated, it will lead to an unstable economy and an increase in crimes in the country with illegal transactions, so there is a need to authenticate notes. As fake notes are made with precision, there is a need for an efficient algorithm that can distinguish between genuine banknotes and fake notes. The project proposes methods for evaluating the authenticity of banknotes by using machine learning techniques. Furthermore, the algorithm is used to predict the genuinity of the notes.
